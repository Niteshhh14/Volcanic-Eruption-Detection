# Volcanic Eruption Detection using STFT (MATLAB) ðŸš¨ðŸŒ‹

This project detects volcanic eruptions by analyzing seismic signals in MATLAB using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Kalman Filtering. The system processes seismic data to filter noise, detect eruption patterns, and provide early-warning signals.

## Features
- **STFT** for frequency analysis of seismic signals.
- **Kalman Filtering** for noise reduction and signal smoothing.
- Real-time eruption detection based on seismic data.

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB (R2020 or later recommended)
- Required MATLAB toolboxes: Signal Processing, Kalman Filtering

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the MATLAB script (`volcanic_eruption_detection.m`).
3. Run the script in MATLAB to analyze seismic data:
   ```matlab
   run('volcanic_eruption_detection.m')
